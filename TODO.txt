BUGS
 - sometimes not killed my landing on a glitch tile (only seen when block is going up) (system ordering issue?) (do we set the player velocity to the tiles vel?)
 - riding on bouncy tile does not always let you super bounce
 - clean up duplicate code for color source consumption
 - end of level time / stars
 - start timer once player moves
