outline entire map in no-op but visible tiles
README especially for creating your own maps

clean up collision checking.. have collision system that sends "touching tiles" component?
clean up: all systems in own file
add teleport sound on edge warp (add visual effect too?)

add pause?

additional music, can be dynamically generated?!!
allow continuation of command blocks (last block binary for "next line"?)

coop mode?  power ups?  
make particle system an entity instead of each particle

splash screen
main menu? maybe not.

test in win8!

juice:
  particles on magic / reset / rainbow pixels
  make Monster jelly like and squishy (on horizontal movement)

builds
  windows
  mac
  linux?


BUGS
 - make monster system respect dt in all cases (allowing for varying of update freq)
 - sometimes not killed my landing on a glitch tile (only seen when block is going up) (system ordering issue?) (do we set the player velocity to the tiles vel?)
 - riding on bouncy tile does not always let you super bounce
 - clean up duplicate code for color source consumption
 - end of level time / stars
 - start timer once player moves

DONE
allow larger than 32x32 maps
level to show off / teach ghost tiles
